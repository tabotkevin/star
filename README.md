# Python-Django Task

Hello,

It is said that in the alternative universe there are a bunch of movies about this universe. They would like to be able to get some more information about it. You can receive this information from special data transfer portal at https://swapi.dev/. They want to see this data on their computers. Those computers only support one type of interface called REST API. Here is what they want to know.

- Based on starship's id or creator (producer of a film in which starship has been seen. there can be multiple people and multiple films) they want to know what species could have seen it (we can assume that any specie that has been in a given movie could have seen it).

- How much units of given starship (id) would they need to evacuate given planet (id or name)

- They also want to be able to create new types of starships

It's up to you to decide how would you like to represent the data.

#### Instructions

- Your goal is to implement REST API in Django.
- Create a branch and PR to capture all of your commits.
- You are free to use any third-party libraries and database of your choice. Make sure you share your reasoning behind choosing each of them.
- Basic tests for endpoints and their functionality are required. Their exact scope and form is left up to you.
- Create an `EXPLANATION.md` and think out-loud. Explain what you found, did, didn't do, and why. Share your reasoning. Be specific.
